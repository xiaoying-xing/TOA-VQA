Question: What color is this person's coat?
Caption: a person in green coat skiing down a snowy slope
AI: Reasoning: From the image captioning, we know that the person is wearing a green coat. We can verify the color of the coat. Hypothesis: [green] Verification: query_attribute(coat, color) Answer: None
Human: green
AI: Reasoning: Since the vision model verifies the hypothesis, we can decide the answer. Hypothesis: None Verification: None Answer: green

Question: What is the name of the food shown?
Caption: a pizza with a slice missing
AI: Reasoning: Since the caption mentions a pizza, we can verify if there exists a pizza in the image. Hypothesis: [pizza] Verification: exist(pizza) Answer: None

Question: What color is the railing on the deck?
Caption: a vase of flowers in front of a window with a brown railing on the deck
AI: Reasoning: From the image captioning, we know that the railing on the deck is brown. We can verify using the vision model. Hypothesis: [brown] Verification: filter(railing, brown) Answer: None
Human: False
AI: Reasoning: The vision model conflicts with current hypothesis. We need to further query about the attribute. Hypothesis: None Verification: query_attribute(railing, color) Answer: None
Human: yellow
AI: Reasoning: We can decide the answer according to the vision model. Hypothesis: None Verification: None Answer: yellow

Question: What Wii game is the person playing?
Caption: a person playing a wii game
AI: Reasoning: Since the question asks about the Wii game being played, we first locate the person in the image. Hypothesis: None Verification: locate(person) Answer: None
Human: Located person
AI: Reasoning: Since we have located the person playing the Wii game, we can use the vision model to obtain the answer. Hypothesis: None Verification: simple_query(What Wii game is the person playing?) Answer: None
Human: golf
AI: Reasoning: Since the simple query provides the answer, we can decide the answer. Hypothesis: None Verification: None Answer: golf

Question: Is this a jungle?
Caption: a herd of elephants walking down a dirt road
AI: Reasoning: Since there are elephants, it is probably a jungle. We can verify it using the vision model. Hypothesis: [yes] Verification: simple_query(Is this a jungle?) Answer: None
Human: yes
AI: Reasoning: The verification agrees with the hypothesis, so we can conclude that it is a jungle. Hypothesis: None Verification: None Answer: yes

Question: Can you see mountains?

AI: Reasoning: Since the caption mentions mountains in the background, we can verify if mountains are visible in the image. Hypothesis: [yes] Verification: exist(mountains) Answer: None
Human: True
AI: Reasoning: The verification agrees with the hypothesis, so we can decide the answer. Hypothesis: None Verification: None Answer: yes

Question: How many steps are in the flight of stairs?
Caption: a sheep standing in the middle of a field of flowers with 2 steps in the flight of stairs
AI: Reasoning: Since the caption mentions that there are 2 steps in the flight of stairs, we can directly verify this information. Hypothesis: [2] Verification: count(steps) Answer: None
Human: 4
AI: Reasoning: The verification conflicts with the hypothesis. We call the simple_query function to obtain the answer. Hypothesis: [2,4] Verification: simple_query(How many steps are in the flight of stairs?) Answer: None
Human: 10
AI: Reasoning: Since the verification provides a different answer, we can decide the answer with maximum probability. Hypothesis: None Verification: None Answer: ten
